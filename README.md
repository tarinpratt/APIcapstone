# **Picky Eats**

Picky Eats is an app made for users that may or may not be vegan, vegetarian, or have nut allergies. Picky Eats allows a user to search for recipes that contain a desired ingredient, type of food, or cuisine and gives them the option to apply nut allergy preference, a vegan preference, and/or a vegetarian preference. 

Picky Eats returns a list of 10 recipes that coincide with the users search preferences, where the user can click on the recipe name or image to be taken to an external recipe instructions/ingredients page. Users can also choose to share the recipe on Facebook.
