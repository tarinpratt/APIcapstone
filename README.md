Picky Eats

Picky Eats is an app geared towards users with nut allergies searching for Vegan or Vegetarian recipes. 
Picky Eats allows a user to search for any amount or combination of ingredients that they would like to see in their dish and gives them the option to apply nut allergy preference, a vegan preference, and/or a vegetarian preference. 
Picky Eats returns a list of 10 recipes that coincide with the users search preferences, where the user can now click on the recipe name or image to be taken to an external recipe instructions/ingredients page. Users can also choose to share the recipe on Facebook.
